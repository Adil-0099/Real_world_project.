# 🧠 Reviving Helmet Sales – A Data-Driven Business Turnaround

This project showcases how a traditional 10-year-old offline helmet store on the verge of shutting down was revived using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **strategic business thinking**. The shop lacked digital infrastructure, customer data, and was losing ground to e-commerce giants like Amazon, Zepto, and Flipkart.

> 📈 **Result**: ₹1.12 Lakhs revenue increase in 2 months and 20% boost in units sold.
